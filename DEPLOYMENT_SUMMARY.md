## 🔧 What Was Changed

### 1. File Path Updates
**Before:**
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/common.css" />
<script src="js/core/app.js"></script>
<img src="assets/images/logo.png" />
<a href="login.html">Login</a>
```

**After:**
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./css/common.css" />
<script src="./js/core/app.js"></script>
<img src="./assets/images/logo.png" />
<a href="./login.html">Login</a>
```

### 2. Environment Detection
Created `config.js` with automatic detection:
```javascript
const isGitHubPages = window.location.hostname.includes('github.io');
const basePath = isGitHubPages ? '/cloud-kitchen' : '';
```

### 3. GitHub Actions Workflow
Automated deployment on every push to main branch

### 4. Service Worker
Already uses relative paths - no changes needed!
